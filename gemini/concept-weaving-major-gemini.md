[Gemini]
Welcome to the **Department of Consilience and Cognitive Cartography**.

**Major:** Big-Picture Weaving (B.P.W.)
**Degree:** Bachelor of Arts
**Motto:** *Tug the Universal Thread.*

This major is for the relentlessly curious, the pattern-seekers, and the intellectual weavers. We reject the notion that knowledge must live in isolated silos. Instead, we treat all of human thought‚Äîfrom quantum physics to ancient mythology, from economic theory to musical composition‚Äîas threads of a single, magnificent tapestry. Our goal is not to master one thread, but to learn the art of braiding them together into a strong, glowing rope. Then, we give it a tug to see what the whole system does. üåç‚ú®

## Core Curriculum: The Art of the Braid

The B.P.W. curriculum is a four-year journey from gathering individual threads to weaving the grand rope and, finally, testing its strength.

### **Year 1: Gathering the Threads**

The first year is about collecting your raw materials. You'll learn how to ask better questions, how different fields create and validate knowledge, and how to appreciate the foundational stories and systems that shape our reality.

* **BPW 101: The Art of the Question**
    This course isn't about finding answers; it's about manufacturing better questions. We'll study the Socratic method, the "Five Whys" of engineering, the koans of Zen, and the thought experiments of physicists. You'll learn to chase a question until it giggles and tells you where the *real* secrets are hidden.

* **BPW 102: Maps of Everything**
    An introduction to the major models of reality. In one semester, you'll sprint through the Standard Model of particle physics, the periodic table, the double helix, the hero's journey, game theory, and the core tenets of the world's major religions. The goal isn't expertise; it's literacy. You'll learn the basic grammar of every major intellectual language. 

* **BPW 103: The Grammar of Reality**
    How do the underlying rules of one system show up in another? This course explores the universal patterns: feedback loops, fractals, emergence, and network effects as they appear in biology, economics, linguistics, and art.

* **BPW 104: A History of Awe**
    We will catalog the moments that made humanity gasp. From the first cave painting to the first view of Earth from space, we will study the history of paradigm-shifting ideas and the feeling of wonder that created them.

---

### **Year 2: Finding the Patterns**

Now that you have a basket full of threads, you'll learn to see the echoes and rhymes across disciplines. This year is about making connections that nobody else thought to look for.

* **BPW 201: Echoes & Rhymes: The Physics of Metaphor**
    Why is "the flow of time" such a powerful metaphor? What does the branching of a tree have in common with the structure of a good argument? We‚Äôll explore how the physical laws of the universe (gravity, entropy, evolution) secretly structure our language, art, and social systems.

* **BPW 202: Codes, Cults, and Consciousness**
    This course examines the software of the human mind. We‚Äôll investigate how symbolic language created collective belief, the mechanics of propaganda and ideology, the structure of myths, and the modern "cults" of brands and political movements. We'll ask: What is consciousness, and can we rewrite its code?

* **BPW 203: The Biology of Belief**
    An exploration of how our evolutionary history shaped our brains for storytelling, tribalism, and spirituality. We'll look at the neuroscience of empathy, the hormonal basis for trust, and why humans are the only animals who invent gods and build civilizations.

---

### **Year 3: The Weaving Workshop**

This is where you get your hands dirty. The third year is project-based, moving from theory to the active practice of synthesis.

* **BPW 301: Systems & Synthesis Lab**
    In this workshop, you'll be given two seemingly unrelated concepts (e.g., "the principles of jazz improvisation" and "supply chain logistics") and be tasked with building a model, essay, or work of art that braids them into a coherent whole.

* **BPW 302: Narrative Engineering**
    Stories are the operating system of humanity. Here, you'll learn to deconstruct and reconstruct them. You‚Äôll design a new myth for the 21st century, create a unifying narrative for a divided community, or develop a story powerful enough to change someone's mind.

* **BPW 303: Applied Anachronism**
    Can we solve modern problems with ancient wisdom? This course tasks students with applying historical and philosophical frameworks to contemporary challenges. How would Aristotle design a social media algorithm? What would the Stoics say about climate change?

---

### **Year 4: Tugging the Rope**

The final year is about pulling on the rope you've spent three years weaving. It's about seeing what happens when you introduce a new idea into the system or apply your integrated knowledge to a real-world problem.

* **BPW 401: The Speculative Futures Symposium**
    Working in teams, you will model the second- and third-order consequences of a single technological or social change (e.g., "What happens to the concept of family if artificial wombs become common?"). The goal is to anticipate the ripples, not just the splash.

* **BPW 402: The Ethics of Tugging**
    If you have a rope woven from all of human thought, tugging it has consequences. This course is a deep dive into the moral responsibility of the Big-Picture Weaver. When is a system too fragile to disturb? Who gives you the right to tug in the first place?

* **BPW 499: The Grand Synthesis (Capstone Project)**
    Your final task is to complete **The Tug**. You must identify a broken or disconnected part of our world‚Äîbe it in science, politics, art, or community‚Äîand weave a new connection. You will present a project that is not just an analysis, but an intervention. You will braid a new thread into the human story and give it a gentle, deliberate pull. üß†

**Graduation Requirement:** Present a novel synthesis that makes at least three people from different academic disciplines say, "Huh. I never thought of it that way before.

Of course. Here is the requisite reading list for the **Bachelor of Arts in Big-Picture Weaving**. These texts are chosen not just for their content, but for their ability to rewire how you think, providing the foundational threads for your intellectual loom.
