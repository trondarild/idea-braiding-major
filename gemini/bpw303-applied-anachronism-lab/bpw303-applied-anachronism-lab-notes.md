We now arrive at the final workshop of the third year, the capstone of the Weaver's Studio.

**BPW 303** is the ultimate test of a weaver's skill: the ability to bridge the vast chasm of time. This lab rejects the notion that "new problems require new ideas." Instead, we will treat ancient texts not as historical artifacts, but as battle-tested operating manuals for the unchanging hardware of the human condition. Your task is to apply these powerful, pre-modern frameworks to the complex, chaotic, and often technological challenges of the 21st century.

Our studio manuals by Sun Tzu, Marcus Aurelius, and Machiavelli are our chosen frameworks for strategy, ethics, and power, respectively.

Here is the outline of our four anachronistic projects.

---

### **Project 1: The Art of the Silent War (Weeks 1-3)**

* **Core Synthesis Challenge:** To develop a complete strategic plan for a modern grassroots environmental movement using *only* the principles found in Sun Tzu's *The Art of War*.
* **The Provocation Package Will Contain:**
    * The full text of *The Art of War*.
    * A detailed case study of a modern environmental challenge, for instance, the effort to protect the Oresund strait from a specific pollutant.
    * The organizational structure and stated goals of an activist group like Fridays for Future.
    * An analysis of the political and corporate "terrain" on which this conflict is taking place.
* **Studio Focus:** This project is a rigorous exercise in strategic translation. The goal is to move beyond the literal context of ancient warfare to grasp the abstract principles of leverage, intelligence, deception, and resource management. How do you apply "the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting" when your "enemy" is public apathy or corporate inertia?
* **Potential Final Artifacts:**
    * A strategic plan presented to the movement's leadership, outlining campaigns based on principles of indirect engagement and attacking the "enemy's" strategy.
    * A "playbook" of non-violent tactics derived from Sun Tzu's teachings on deception, alliances, and exploiting weakness.
    * A "terrain map" of the political and media landscape, identifying key leverage points for minimal effort and maximum impact.

### **Project 2: The Stoic Operating System (Weeks 4-6)**

* **Core Synthesis Challenge:** To design a comprehensive mental health and resilience framework for professionals in a high-stress, unpredictable field (like emergency room doctors or humanitarian aid workers), based *entirely* on the Stoic principles in Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations*.
* **The Provocation Package Will Contain:**
    * The full text of *Meditations*.
    * Interviews and articles documenting the psychological challenges (burnout, moral injury, anxiety) faced in the chosen profession.
    * A case study on existing (and often failing) wellness programs in these fields.
* **Studio Focus:** This is a project of applied ethical design. The challenge is to translate Aurelius's private philosophical practice into a teachable, practical, public curriculum. How do you operationalize concepts like the "dichotomy of control," viewing obstacles as opportunities (*the obstacle is the way*), and maintaining an "inner citadel" in the face of chaos?
* **Potential Final Artifacts:**
    * A curriculum and set of practical exercises for a "Stoic Resilience Training" workshop.
    * A personal handbook or "Enchiridion" written for someone in the target profession.
    * A policy proposal for an organization on how to build a Stoic-informed culture that reduces burnout and supports its staff.

### **Project 3: The Prince of the Platform (Weeks 7-9)**

* **Core Synthesis Challenge:** To conduct a Machiavellian analysis of the power dynamics among major social media platforms and global regulators, and produce a confidential advisory memo for the CEO of a new, emerging platform on how to survive and gain power.
* **The Provocation Package Will Contain:**
    * The full text of Machiavelli's *The Prince*.
    * Financial reports and user data for platforms like Meta, TikTok, and X.
    * A summary of recent EU and US regulatory actions and proposals concerning Big Tech.
    * A biography of a famously ruthless and successful tech founder.
* **Studio Focus:** This project demands a cold, pragmatic analysis of power, stripped of moral judgment. Students must think like Machiavelli, mapping the realpolitik of the digital world. Who holds the *de facto* power? What are the roles of "virtù" (technological innovation, strategic cunning) and "fortuna" (market trends, political shifts)? Is it better for a platform to be "loved" (by its users) or "feared" (by its competitors and regulators)? The ethical discomfort is a key part of the learning.
* **Potential Final Artifacts:**
    * A confidential memo to the CEO, outlining a strategy for navigating the political landscape, forming alliances, and neutralizing threats.
    * A detailed "map of powers," identifying the "princes" (CEOs), "mercenaries" (influencers), and "fortresses" (proprietary algorithms) of the tech world.
    * A case study analyzing a past corporate failure (e.g., Myspace) through a purely Machiavellian lens.

### **Project 4: The Philosopher's Algorithm (Weeks 10-12)**

* **Core Synthesis Challenge:** This is the capstone. Students will select a pre-modern ethical or political framework not yet covered (e.g., Aristotle's virtue ethics, Plato's Republic, Confucianism, Ibn Khaldun's *Muqaddimah*) and use it to design the governing principles for a municipal AI system in a city like Höganäs.
* **The Provocation Package Will Contain:**
    * This is largely self-directed. Students will choose their philosophical text.
    * The studio will provide a set of specific modern challenges for the AI to manage: optimizing public transport, allocating social housing, managing waste collection, and moderating a digital town forum.
* **Studio Focus:** This project integrates the entire third-year curriculum. It is the ultimate act of translation: converting an ancient ethical worldview into a set of rules and priorities that could be encoded into a machine. How would an Aristotelian AI define and optimize for citizen *eudaimonia* (flourishing)? How would a Confucian AI prioritize social harmony and respect for elders in its decisions? The rigor of translating abstract virtues into concrete, programmable logic is the final test.
* **Potential Final Artifacts:**
    * A formal "Ethical Constitution for a Municipal AI," which could be presented to the city council, justifying each principle with direct reference to the chosen philosophical text.
    * A comparative analysis showing how their "Platonic AI" would make a different decision on a contentious issue compared to a purely utilitarian AI.
    * A presentation that defends their framework and grapples with the potential unintended consequences of embedding ancient virtues into modern civic technology.
