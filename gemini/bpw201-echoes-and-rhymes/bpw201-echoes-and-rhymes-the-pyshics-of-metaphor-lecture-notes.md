The first course of the second year, **BPW 201**, is designed to give you a new kind of vision—the ability to see the ghost of a physical law in a line of poetry, the echo of an evolutionary strategy in a business model, and the structure of a branching river in a well-told story.

### **BPW 201: Echoes & Rhymes: The Physics of Metaphor**
*Course Lecture Schedule*

### **Lecture 1: The Blueprint in the Brain - Metaphor as a Cognitive Engine**

* **Part 1 (Hour 1): Deconstructing the Idea that "Argument is War"**
    We begin by dismantling the common belief that metaphor is mere poetic flair. Using Lakoff & Johnson's foundational work, we will dissect a single, pervasive conceptual metaphor: ARGUMENT IS WAR. We will explore why we use language of combat—*attacking* positions, *defending* claims, *winning* and *losing* debates. This isn't arbitrary; it's a cognitive framework that dictates our behaviour. To prove this, we will then workshop an alternative—what if ARGUMENT IS A DANCE? How would that change our goals, our language, and our conduct?

* **Part 2 (Hour 2): The Body as the Source Code of Abstract Thought**
    This hour establishes the core theory for the course. We will learn that the human mind comprehends abstract concepts (target domains) by mapping them onto concrete, physical experiences (source domains). We will identify and analyze the "primary metaphors" that are baked into our cognition by our physical existence: MORE IS UP (prices *rise*), AFFECTION IS WARMTH (a *warm* greeting), DIFFICULTIES ARE BURDENS (*weighed down* by problems), CATEGORIES ARE CONTAINERS (*in* love, *out* of touch). This is the universal source code from which more complex metaphors are built.

### **Lecture 2: The Universal Laws - Gravity, Entropy, and the Shape of Stories**

* **Part 1 (Hour 1): The Gravitational Pull of a "Heavy" Idea**
    This hour explores how the fundamental laws of physics secretly structure our abstract world. We will investigate the metaphorical echoes of **gravity**: why are important matters "heavy"? Why do we "fall" asleep or "fall" in love? Why do we feel "grounded"? We then move to **thermodynamics**, examining how the Second Law (entropy) and the "arrow of time" have created a deep cognitive link between time, motion, and linearity, forcing us to conceptualize time as a moving object, a river, or a path we walk upon.

* **Part 2 (Hour 2): The Inevitable Arc - Physics in Narrative Structure**
    Why do so many stories feel the same? This hour argues that narrative structure often rhymes with physical processes. We will look at how the physics of **cycles** (seasons, tides, day/night) are mirrored in our mythological narratives of birth, death, and rebirth. We'll connect the classic three-act plot structure (equilibrium, disruption, new equilibrium) directly to the systemic principle (from BPW 103) of a stable system being perturbed and eventually finding a new state of balance. The "arc" of a story is often the arc of a physical event.

### **Lecture 3: The Evolutionary Echo - Competition, Adaptation, and the Marketplace of Ideas**

* **Part 1 (Hour 1): The Ecosystem of Culture and the Life Cycle of a Meme**
    This hour applies the powerful map of Darwinian evolution to the world of ideas. We will explore the concept of **memetics**: treating ideas, trends, and ideologies as "memes" that replicate, mutate, and compete for survival in the finite ecosystem of human attention. We will analyze how this metaphor of "survival of the fittest" has come to dominate our understanding of everything from corporate strategy ("adapt or die") to artistic movements.

* **Part 2 (Hour 2): The Body Politic and the Health of the Nation**
    Here we examine a different biological metaphor: not of competition, but of the integrated **organism**. We will explore how we map the parts of a human body onto our societies—the "head of state," the "heart of the city," the "arteries of commerce." Drawing on Foucault, we will analyze the power of this metaphor. When a society is seen as a body, governments can diagnose "illnesses," treat dissent as a "cancer," and strive for the "health" of the economy, shaping social policy in profound ways.

### **Lecture 4: The Weaver's Workshop - Deconstructing and Designing New Worlds**

* **Part 1 (Hour 1): The Prison and the Palace of Language**
    This critical hour synthesizes the course by examining the dual nature of metaphor. Metaphors illuminate, but they also cast shadows, constraining our thought in invisible ways. We'll analyze how a ruling metaphor like "the economy is a machine" can blind us to its human and ecological dimensions. Or how treating cancer as a "war" can frame death as a personal failure. The first act of a Big-Picture Weaver is often to identify and question the ruling metaphor of a system.

* **Part 2 (Hour 2): Building Invisible Cities of the Mind**
    The final hour is a creative workshop inspired by Italo Calvino's *Invisible Cities*. Calvino doesn't just describe cities; he builds entire worlds from single, extended metaphors. His work is a masterclass in seeing how a new metaphor can generate a new reality. The final assignment will be to emulate this process: students will select a complex abstract concept—like "privacy," "grief," or "education"—and design a new, powerful conceptual metaphor for it, presenting a short "Calvino-esque" description of the world as seen through this new lens.
