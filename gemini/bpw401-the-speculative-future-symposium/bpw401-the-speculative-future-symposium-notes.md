This is a year-long, team-based deep dive into the art and science of structured foresight. Your team will not just be discussing the future; you will be building a coherent, plausible, and deeply researched model of it, and then attempting to intervene in it.

The core texts by Kahneman, Taleb, and Le Guin are your essential tools for this journey. Kahneman will teach you to distrust your own predictions. Taleb will force you to account for the impossible. Le Guin will show you what a masterful, fully-realized thought experiment looks like.

### **Component A: The Weaver's Guild Symposium Track (BPW 401)**

#### **Goal: To collaboratively model a future world transformed by a single disruptive premise, and to design and defend a strategic intervention for that new world.**

### **Semester 1: World-Building & Consequence Mapping**

The first half of the year is dedicated to rigorous research, mapping, and building the foundations of your future scenario.

* **Phase I: The Premise Draft (Weeks 1-3)**
    * Your Guild team will select one prompt from a curated list of disruptive, world-altering premises. Examples for the 2025-2026 academic year include:
        * **The Biological Premise:** A technology for reliable, cheap, and widespread human genetic engineering becomes available over-the-counter.
        * **The Economic Premise:** A universal basic income, pegged to local productivity, is adopted by the majority of G20 nations.
        * **The Ecological Premise:** A breakthrough in microbial science allows for the rapid and near-total decomposition of plastics in the environment.
        * **The Neurological Premise:** A non-invasive brain-computer interface allows for the silent, text-based transmission of thought between consenting individuals.
    * Your first deliverable is a **Premise Draft**: a formal proposal arguing why your chosen premise is the most fertile ground for a year-long investigation.

* **Phase II: De-Biasing and Black Swan Simulation (Weeks 4-6)**
    * Before you build, you must learn the flaws in your own thinking. This phase is an intensive workshop based on Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow* and Taleb's *The Black Swan*.
    * **Provocation:** Your team will analyze your Premise Draft, identifying your own inherent cognitive biases (e.g., optimism bias, availability heuristic). You will then conduct a "Black Swan Simulation," brainstorming a list of low-probability, high-impact events that could completely shatter your initial assumptions about the future.
    * **Studio Focus:** The faculty ("World-Building Consultants") will facilitate a "premortem" analysis for each team, forcing you to assume your future model has already failed and to work backwards to find the hidden points of fragility.

* **Phase III: Multi-Layered Consequence Mapping (Weeks 7-12)**
    * This is the heart of the first semester's work. Your team must create a rich, detailed "World Bible" for your future scenario, weaving together multiple maps of reality. Your model must address:
        * **Systems & Economics:** How have supply chains, feedback loops, and economic incentives been rewired?
        * **Narrative & Myth:** What are the new dominant stories, metaphors, and ideologies? Who are the new heroes and villains?
        * **Biology & Ethics:** How has this changed our understanding of the human being, the family, the tribe? What are the new moral dilemmas?
        * **Politics & Power:** What are the new geopolitical fault lines? How have the principles of Sun Tzu or Machiavelli been adapted to this new terrain?
    * Ursula K. Le Guin's *The Dispossessed* will serve as your benchmark for what a plausible, deeply considered, and internally consistent world looks like.

### **Semester 2: Intervention & Public Symposium**

The second half of the year is about moving from analysis to action. Having built your world, you must now act within it.

* **Phase IV: The Intervention Design (Weeks 13-18)**
    * Based on the challenges and opportunities identified in your World Bible, your team will design a specific, actionable **Intervention**. This is not a vague wish, but a concrete proposal. It could be:
        * The constitution for a new governing body.
        * The business plan for a world-changing company.
        * The curriculum for a new educational system.
        * The scripture and rituals for a new social movement.
    * Your design must be justified by the internal logic of your future world.

* **Phase V: The Red Team Rehearsal (Weeks 19-21)**
    * Your team will present your fully-designed Intervention to another Guild team, who will be assigned the role of a "Red Team." Their sole purpose is to be your adversary: to pick apart your intervention, find its unintended consequences, and demonstrate how it could fail, backfire, or be co-opted for nefarious purposes. This is a high-intensity session of peer-review designed to pressure-test your ideas.

* **Phase VI: The Symposium (Weeks 22-24)**
    * The year culminates in the **Big-Picture Weaving Symposium**. This is a public event, open to the university and local community, including leaders from Höganäs and the wider region.
    * Your team will deliver a clear, compelling, 20-minute presentation summarizing your future world, the crisis or opportunity it faces, and your proposed Intervention.
    * This will be followed by a rigorous 20-minute Q&A session with a panel of faculty and guest experts, who will challenge you to defend your speculative model and the ethics of your intervention. Your final grade is based on the coherence of your world, the ingenuity of your intervention, and the quality of your defense.
