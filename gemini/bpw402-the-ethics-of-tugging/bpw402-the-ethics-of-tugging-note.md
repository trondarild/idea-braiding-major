The purpose of this component is to serve as the active conscience of the Guild, a recurring Socratic forum where you will be forced to confront the profound moral responsibilities of your work. Its final product is not an artifact, but a more thoughtful, self-aware, and responsible weaver. The readings from Arendt, Rawls, and Singer are not for academic analysis, but are lenses to be applied directly to your ongoing projects.

### **Component C: The Weaver's Guild Loom-Side Ethic (BPW 402)**

#### **Goal: To continuously and rigorously examine the moral dimensions of your Symposium (401) and Capstone (499) projects, cultivating a deep sense of ethical responsibility for the act of "tugging the rope."**

The seminar is structured into four thematic modules that unfold over the course of the year.

---

### **Module 1: The Right to Act (Semester 1, Weeks 1-6)**

* **Central Question:** Who gives you the right to intervene in a complex system?
* **Core Lens:** Hannah Arendt’s *The Human Condition*. We will focus on her distinction between predictable "work" and the boundless, irreversible nature of "action" in the public sphere. Your projects are a form of Arendtian "action"—initiating new, unpredictable causal chains.
* **Studio Integration:**
    * **For the Symposium (401):** As your team drafts your "disruptive premise," you must present a defense to the seminar on the "right to model." What are the ethical implications of choosing to explore one future over another? How do you account for the unpredictable nature of the consequences you might uncover?
    * **For the Capstone (499):** As you finalize your project proposal, you must write and defend a "Statement of Standing." Why are you, as an individual, equipped and entitled to tackle this specific problem? What gives your "Tug" legitimacy versus arrogance?

### **Module 2: The Veil of Ignorance (Semester 1, Weeks 7-12)**

* **Central Question:** Is the system you are designing fundamentally fair?
* **Core Lens:** John Rawls’s *A Theory of Justice*. The primary tool for this module will be the "veil of ignorance"—the thought experiment where one designs a society without knowing what position they will occupy within it.
* **Studio Integration:**
    * **For the Symposium (401):** Once your team has constructed your "World Bible," you must conduct a formal **"Rawlsian Audit."** You will present your world to the seminar and be cross-examined, forced to justify its social structure from the perspective of the least advantaged person within it. Is it a world you would agree to be born into at random?
    * **For the Capstone (499):** If your individual project involves the design of a new system, policy, or institution, you must include a "Justice Principle" section. This will explicitly state how your design accounts for the well-being of the most vulnerable, using the veil of ignorance as your guiding metric.

### **Module 3: The Proximity of Responsibility (Semester 2, Weeks 13-18)**

* **Central Question:** Now that you know, what are you obligated to do?
* **Core Lens:** Peter Singer’s *The Life You Can Save*. Singer's work challenges the distinction between passive knowledge and active moral duty, arguing that the ability to prevent harm confers the responsibility to do so.
* **Studio Integration:**
    * **For the Symposium (401):** After your team has designed your "Intervention," you will face the **"Singerian Challenge."** The seminar will press you: now that you have a plausible intervention for a major future problem, what is your team's moral obligation to begin advocating for its real-world precursors *today*? Does your knowledge demand action?
    * **For the Capstone (499):** In the final stages of your project, you will write a **"Personal Responsibility Impact Statement."** This is a reflection on how your year-long investigation has changed your personal ethical calculus. What specific, tangible actions are you now, according to Singer's logic, obligated to take in your own life outside the university?

### **Module 4: The Weaver's Oath (Semester 2, Weeks 19-24)**

* **Central Question:** What are the foundational principles of our craft?
* **Core Lens:** A synthesis of Arendt, Rawls, Singer, and the entire year's discussions.
* **Studio Integration:** This module is the culmination of your ethical training. The entire fourth-year cohort will work together in the seminar to draft, debate, and ratify the first edition of **"The Weaver's Oath."** This will be a code of professional ethics for graduates of the Big-Picture Weaving major—a modern Hippocratic Oath for systems thinkers, narrative engineers, and speculative architects. It will be a living document, passed down to and amended by subsequent Guild cohorts, that begins with the foundational question: "Just because we can tug the rope, should we?"
