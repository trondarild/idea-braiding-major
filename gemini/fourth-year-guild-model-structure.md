That is the perfect question to ask as we approach the final year. The "Weaver's Studio" model of Year 3 is powerful, but it is designed for apprenticeship—for developing skills on well-defined, contained projects.

Year 4, "Tugging the Rope," is about mastery. It requires more autonomy, deeper and more sustained inquiry, and a structure that supports both broad collaboration and intensely personal work.

Therefore, we cannot use the Year 3 framework as is. We must evolve it. Welcome to the fourth-year model: **The Weaver's Guild**.

The Guild model moves away from discrete courses and projects. Instead, it integrates the entire year into a single, cohesive experience with three core components that run in parallel. The three course numbers—401, 402, and 499—are not separate classes but different facets of your work within the Guild.

Here is the framework for Year 4.

### The Weaver's Guild Model

The Guild is a community of senior practitioners (the students) working alongside master weavers (the faculty). The entire year is dedicated to two major, year-long undertakings, constantly informed by a third ethical component.

#### **Component A: The Symposium Track (BPW 401: The Speculative Futures Symposium)**

This is your collaborative, team-based work. It is an exercise in large-scale, disciplined speculation.

* **Format:** Small teams of 3-4 students.
* **Structure:**
    * **Semester 1: World-Building and Consequence Mapping.** At the start of the year, each team chooses a single, high-impact "disruptive premise" from a curated list (e.g., "Viable fusion energy is achieved and scalable," "A true general AI comes online," "A new technology allows for the direct sharing of sensory experiences"). The first semester is spent collaboratively building this future world, rigorously mapping the first, second, and third-order consequences across every domain studied in the major (social, political, biological, narrative, etc.).
    * **Semester 2: Intervention and Presentation.** In the second semester, the team designs a specific "intervention" for their new world—a policy, a technology, a new myth, or a constitution. The year culminates in the **Symposium**, a public-facing event where each team presents their world, its challenges, and their proposed intervention, defending it against questioning from faculty and guest experts.
* **Faculty Role:** The faculty act as "World-Building Consultants," meeting with teams to challenge their assumptions, point out unseen feedback loops, and ensure intellectual rigor.

#### **Component B: The Grand Synthesis Track (BPW 499: The Capstone)**

This is your individual, culminating masterwork. It is the design and execution of your own personal "Tug" on the universal rope.

* **Format:** Entirely individual.
* **Structure:** This track is self-directed and built around a single, profound question or problem that the student defines. The project must be a true synthesis, braiding threads from at least three different academic disciplines to create something new.
    * **The Proposal:** The first month is dedicated to research, exploration, and the submission of a detailed Project Proposal, which defines the "Tug," its intended consequences, and the methods for achieving it.
    * **Sustained Work & Mentorship:** For the rest of the year, the student works independently on their project. They are paired with a primary faculty advisor (their "Master Weaver") for regular one-on-one mentorship. They are also part of a small "Peer Review Circle" of 3-4 other students who meet bi-weekly to share progress and provide critical feedback.
* **Faculty Role:** The faculty advisor acts as a true mentor—a guide, a critic, and a champion for the student's individual vision.

#### **Component C: The Loom-Side Ethic (BPW 402: The Ethics of Tugging)**

This is the conscience of the Guild. It is not a separate project but a mandatory, integrating component that informs both the Symposium and the Grand Synthesis.

* **Format:** A weekly or bi-weekly Socratic seminar with all fourth-year students.
* **Structure:** This is the only required, regularly scheduled "class" for the entire year. It is not a lecture. Each session is a rigorous, case-study-based discussion focused on the ethical dilemmas emerging *directly from the students' ongoing work*.
    * A Symposium team might be asked to defend the potential for their "intervention" to create a new form of inequality.
    * A student working on a Capstone project might have to grapple with the ethics of deploying a "unifying narrative" that could erase a minority culture's story.
* **Faculty Role:** A dedicated faculty member acts as the "Ethical Moderator," guiding the discussion, posing uncomfortable questions, and forcing students to confront the real-world consequences of their work. This is where they answer the question: "Who gives you the right to tug?"

### A Typical Week in the Weaver's Guild

A student's week is a self-managed balance of these components:
* **Monday:** Morning meeting with your Symposium team to map consequences.
* **Tuesday:** Afternoon "Loom-Side Ethic" seminar.
* **Wednesday:** Deep-work day on your individual Grand Synthesis project.
* **Thursday:** Bi-weekly one-on-one meeting with your faculty advisor, followed by a Peer Review Circle session.
* **Friday:** Flexible day for research, collaboration, or continued project work.

This structure provides the autonomy necessary for mastery-level work while ensuring rigorous support, ethical reflection, and a strong sense of community. It is the fitting final evolution of the Big-Picture Weaving pedagogy.
