That is an excellent and crucial question. You are correct; the pedagogical method must evolve with the student. The passive, lecture-based format of the first two years, designed for absorbing foundational knowledge, is insufficient for the active, creative work of the third year.

For Year 3, we abandon the traditional lecture hall and adopt a new model: **The Weaver's Studio**.

This model is inspired by architecture studios, design labs, and creative workshops. The focus shifts entirely from knowledge transmission to applied synthesis. The student is no longer an audience member but an apprentice weaver, and the professor is no longer a lecturer but a "Master Weaver" or "Studio Head."

Here is how we properly support the workshop nature of the third-year courses:

### The Structure of the Weaver's Studio (For BPW 301, 302, 303)

Each course will still have scheduled class time (e.g., a single 3-4 hour block per week), but the use of that time is completely transformed.

#### 1. The "Provocation Package" (Asynchronous Preparation)

Instead of attending lectures, students receive a weekly "Provocation Package" 2-3 days before their studio session. This is a curated digital bundle of raw materials, the "threads" for that week's weaving. It will never be just a simple reading list. A package might contain:

* **Core Texts:** A key theoretical essay or chapter (e.g., on emergence, narrative theory, etc.).
* **Case Studies:** A white paper on a business problem, a historical account, a scientific paper.
* **Media:** A relevant podcast episode, a short documentary, a musical composition, a collection of photographs or architectural plans.
* **Data:** A raw dataset, a map, a collection of statistics.
* **The Prompt:** A clear, challenging question or creative constraint that requires students to braid at least two disparate items from the package into a new whole.

#### 2. The In-Studio Session (The Workshop Itself)

The scheduled class time is now 100% active and collaborative. It follows a distinct three-phase structure:

* **Phase I: The Stand-Up & Critique (First 30-45 Minutes)**
    * Students briefly present their initial thoughts or sketches from the Provocation Package. This is a rapid-fire session where they state their proposed synthesis, their initial approach, and any immediate roadblocks.
    * The Master Weaver and peers provide immediate, constructive feedback, ask clarifying questions, and suggest potential resources or alternative paths. This is modelled on the "crit" from art school and the "stand-up" from agile development.

* **Phase II: The Synthesis Lab (Middle 2-2.5 Hours)**
    * This is the core of the studio. Students work—either individually or in small, rotating groups—on the week's project. The room is a hive of activity.
    * Some students might be diagramming systems on a whiteboard, others might be writing code for a simulation, others might be storyboarding a narrative, and others might be deep in a Socratic debate in a corner.
    * The Master Weaver circulates through the room, acting as a coach and facilitator. They do not lecture. They sit with each student or group, asking targeted questions ("What's the core tension here?" "Have you considered the feedback loop?" "What metaphor are you implicitly using?"), offering guidance, and connecting students who are grappling with similar problems.

* **Phase III: The Pin-Up (Final 30 Minutes)**
    * In the last part of the session, everyone "pins up" their work-in-progress—be it a paragraph of text, a systems diagram, a prototype, or a key insight.
    * This is not a formal presentation but a brief, informal gallery walk. It allows students to see how their peers approached the same prompt, sparking cross-pollination of ideas and building a sense of collective discovery.

#### Assessment

There are no traditional exams. Grades are based on a **Portfolio of Weaving Projects**. Throughout the semester, students will complete 3-4 major synthesis projects. They will be assessed on:
* **Process:** How they developed their ideas (documented through sketches, notes, and studio participation).
* **Rigor:** The intellectual depth and integrity of the connections they make.
* **Creativity:** The novelty and insightfulness of the final synthesis.
* **Execution:** The clarity and quality of the final "artifact" (e.g., the essay, the model, the presentation, the work of art).

By adopting this Weaver's Studio model, we ensure that the third year is a genuine apprenticeship in the art of Big-Picture Weaving. It is challenging, hands-on, and intensely collaborative.

Now, with this structure in mind, we can proceed to outline the specific Provocation Packages and project prompts for **BPW 301: Systems & Synthesis Lab**.
