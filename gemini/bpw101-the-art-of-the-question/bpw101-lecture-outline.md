**BPW 101: The Art of the Question**, with each two-hour session divided into two distinct parts.

***

### **Lecture 1: The Empty Cup: Why Answers Are Overrated and Ignorance is a Superpower**

* **Part 1 (Hour 1): Deconstructing "Knowing" and the Certainty Trap**
    This hour is about unlearning. We will begin by examining the "right answer" model of traditional education and how it conditions us to fear being wrong. We will then dive into the foundational text for this course, Plato's *Apology*, to understand the Socratic paradox: "I know that I know nothing." We will discuss how this is not a statement of incompetence, but of profound intellectual humility. We will connect this ancient wisdom to the modern psychological discovery of the Dunning-Kruger effect, visually demonstrating how the first step toward genuine expertise is the painful recognition of one's own ignorance.

* **Part 2 (Hour 2): Weaponising "Not Knowing" with Beginner's Mind**
    In this hour, we move from recognising ignorance to actively using it as a tool. We will introduce the Zen concept of *Shoshin* or "Beginner's Mind," the practice of approaching a subject with the openness of someone seeing it for the first time, free from the biases of expertise. We will analyze case studies where major breakthroughs were made by outsiders or amateurs who weren't "smart enough" to know that what they were attempting was impossible. The session will end with a practical exercise: students must identify a subject they feel confident in and then formulate three fundamental questions about it that they cannot answer, forcing them to find the edges of their knowledge.

### **Lecture 2: The Questioner's Toolkit: From Socratic Scalpels to the Five Whys**

* **Part 1 (Hour 1): The Socratic Scalpel - Deconstructive Questioning**
    This hour is dedicated to the primary tool for taking apart an argument: the Socratic method (*Elenchus*). We will break the method down into a clear, repeatable process for questioning a claim to reveal its underlying (and often flawed) assumptions. The majority of this session will be an interactive workshop. As a group, we will take a common, seemingly obvious statement like "Technology connects us," and use the Socratic Scalpel to dissect it in real-time, revealing the complex realities of isolation, echo chambers, and community hidden within.

* **Part 2 (Hour 2): The Diagnostic Engine - Root Cause Questioning**
    Here we shift from deconstruction to diagnosis. We will learn the "Five Whys," the simple but powerful technique developed by Toyota to move past symptoms and find the root cause of a problem. We will walk through the famous case study of the crumbling Jefferson Memorial to show how this iterative questioning can lead to surprising and effective solutions. We will then contrast this with the physicist's tool of the *Gedankenexperiment* (thought experiment), using Einstein's famous example of chasing a beam of light to demonstrate how "What if...?" questions can be used to test the absolute limits of a system's rules.

### **Lecture 3: Hunting for the Giggle: Finding Questions in Paradoxes, Assumptions, and Taboos**

* **Part 1 (Hour 1): Mapping the Hunting Grounds for Good Questions**
    Powerful questions are not invented from scratch; they are discovered. This hour provides a map to the places where they hide. We will learn to identify three key markers: **Paradoxes** (like the Ship of Theseus), which signal an incomplete model of reality; **Anomalies**, data points that don't fit the pattern and hint at a deeper truth; and **Assumptions**, the unstated, "obvious" beliefs that a system is built upon. We will learn that spotting a ruling assumption is like finding a secret blueprint.

* **Part 2 (Hour 2): Listening for What Isn't Said**
    This hour focuses on the social dimension of question hunting. We will discuss **Taboos**—the ideas a group considers too sacred, dangerous, or offensive to question. Challenging a taboo is a direct path to a group's foundational beliefs. We will also celebrate the power of the "dumb question," the kind a child might ask that cuts through jargon and complexity to expose a fundamental absurdity. This is the source of "the giggle"—the nervous, excited feeling that arises when you stumble upon a question that is both slightly forbidden and profoundly important.

### **Lecture 4: The Question as a Journey: How a Single Inquiry Can Weave a New World**

* **Part 1 (Hour 1): The Linchpin Question - How Inquiry Becomes a Catalyst**
    This hour is a historical showcase of "linchpin questions"—single inquiries that changed the world. We will analyze three distinct examples: a scientific question (Einstein's "What if I rode on a beam of light?"), a social question (Betty Friedan's "Is this all?"), and a design question (Steve Jobs' "What if we put 1,000 songs in your pocket?"). For each, we will trace the path from the initial, simple inquiry to the revolutionary paradigm shift it created, demonstrating how a question can be the most powerful lever for change.

* **Part 2 (Hour 2): Your First Thread - The Question Thesis**
    This final hour is the launchpad for the rest of the course and the major. We will frame a great question not as an endpoint, but as a "North Star" that can guide a research project, an artistic career, or a life's work. We will also touch on the ethical responsibilities of the questioner. To conclude, students will be given their main assignment for the semester: to formulate and defend their own "Question Thesis." This is not a statement to be proven, but a single, powerful question that they will commit to exploring, justifying its importance using the tools and concepts learned in these four lectures. This question becomes their first thread in the grand tapestry.
