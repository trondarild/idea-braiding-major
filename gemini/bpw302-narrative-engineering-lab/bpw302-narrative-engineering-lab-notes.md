Excellent. We continue with the Weaver's Studio model for the second workshop of the third year.

In **BPW 302**, we move from synthesizing systems in general to engineering the most powerful system of all: human narrative. This is not a literature class. It is a lab for deconstructing, hacking, and ultimately building stories with the explicit purpose of shaping reality. We will treat myths, political speeches, and brand campaigns as functional code to be analyzed and rewritten.

Our studio manuals by Campbell, Borges, and Monbiot will serve as our guides: Campbell provides the archetypal source code, Borges teaches us how to bend it to our will, and Monbiot shows us how to deploy it in the real world.

Here is the outline of our four narrative engineering projects.

---

### **Project 1: The Narrative X-Ray (Weeks 1-3)**

* **Core Synthesis Challenge:** To dissect both a modern cultural artifact (e.g., the *Star Wars* original trilogy) and a pervasive political narrative (e.g., the "American Dream") using the structural framework of Joseph Campbell's Monomyth.
* **The Provocation Package Will Contain:**
    * Key chapters from Campbell's *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*.
    * The film(s) for analysis.
    * A collection of political speeches and advertisements that invoke the chosen political narrative.
    * An essay on the use of archetypes in modern media.
* **Studio Focus:** This project is a rigorous exercise in deconstruction. The goal is to develop "narrative vision"—the ability to see the ancient, skeletal structure of the Hero's Journey beneath the surface of modern culture. The synthesis lies in demonstrating how this same deep structure powers both epic fantasy and national identity.
* **Potential Final Artifacts:**
    * A detailed infographic that maps both the film and the political narrative onto the 17 stages of the Monomyth.
    * A presentation that analyzes how specific characters, symbols, and plot points in each narrative fulfill their archetypal roles (the Mentor, the Threshold, the Abyss, etc.).
    * A critical essay arguing why this particular narrative structure is so psychologically potent and persistent.

### **Project 2: The Borgesian Labyrinth (Weeks 4-6)**

* **Core Synthesis Challenge:** To take a simple, universally known text (e.g., a religious parable like the Good Samaritan, or the US Pledge of Allegiance) and completely reconstruct it through the lens of a contradictory or alien conceptual framework, inspired by the stories of Borges.
* **The Provocation Package Will Contain:**
    * The chosen source text.
    * Selected stories from Borges's *Labyrinths*, such as "The Library of Babel" or "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote."
    * A primer on a complex system, for example, the rules of quantum entanglement, the principles of formal logic, or the diagnostic criteria from the DSM-5.
    * A short, surreal film (e.g., by Buñuel or Lynch).
* **Studio Focus:** This is a workshop in narrative hacking. The goal is to break free from traditional structures and explore how a story's meaning is radically altered by the conceptual rules that govern its world. What if the Pledge of Allegiance was written by someone who could only speak in logically valid syllogisms? What if the Good Samaritan existed in a quantum state of both helping and not helping?
* **Potential Final Artifacts:**
    * A short story written in the style of Borges that presents the reconstructed narrative.
    * An "annotated" version of the original text, with footnotes explaining its new, bizarre logic.
    * A script for a short film that dramatizes the conceptual collision.

### **Project 3: The Unifying Campfire (Weeks 7-9)**

* **Core Synthesis Challenge:** To identify a specific, real-world social fracture (e.g., the generational divide on climate change, the political polarization in a specific community) and engineer a "bridging narrative" designed to create common ground.
* **The Provocation Package Will Contain:**
    * Selected chapters from Monbiot's *Out of the Wreckage* on the importance of "belonging" and a "restoration story."
    * A curated collection of articles, social media posts, and video clips representing the most passionate voices from both sides of the chosen divide.
    * A case study on a successful instance of restorative justice or a truth and reconciliation commission.
    * A collection of fables from around the world that teach moral lessons.
* **Studio Focus:** This is applied narrative engineering with a clear social goal. The task is not to declare a winner but to change the terms of the debate. Students must dig beneath the conflicting positions to find shared underlying values (e.g., "security," "fairness," "legacy") and then construct a new, simple story—a modern fable—that reframes the issue as a shared challenge rather than a tribal war.
* **Potential Final Artifacts:**
    * A script for a 3-minute animated short film that tells the bridging narrative.
    * A written and recorded story, in the style of a radio address or podcast segment.
    * A strategic plan outlining how and where this new narrative could be deployed for maximum impact.

### **Project 4: A New Myth for the Anthropocene (Weeks 10-12)**

* **Core Synthesis Challenge:** To design and articulate the core components of a new, quasi-mythological story that can offer meaning, purpose, and a guide for action in the 21st-century context of a specific global crisis, such as climate change or AI ethics.
* **The Provocation Package Will Contain:**
    * The full text of Monbiot's *Out of the Wreckage*.
    * Interviews with Joseph Campbell on the function of myth in society.
    * An essay defining the "Anthropocene" and its philosophical implications.
    * Excerpts from founding myths of various cultures (e.g., Genesis, the Enuma Elish, the Popul Vuh).
* **Studio Focus:** This is the capstone: students as modern myth-makers. They must synthesize everything they have learned—archetypal structure, conceptual innovation, and targeted narrative strategy—to build the foundation of a story that can orient humanity in our current, disorienting era. They will need to define: a new concept of heroism, a new definition of "tribe" (humanity? all life?), a new "sacred," and a new vision of a desirable future.
* **Potential Final Artifacts:**
    * A "Myth Bible": A document outlining the core cosmology, key symbols, character archetypes, and narrative arc of the new myth.
    * "The First Sermon": A powerfully written and delivered speech that introduces the core tenets of the myth and calls an audience to a new way of seeing and being.
    * The opening chapter of a foundational text for this new narrative.
