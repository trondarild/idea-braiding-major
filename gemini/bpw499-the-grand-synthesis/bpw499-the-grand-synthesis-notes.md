Here we are. The end of the path, which is, of course, a new beginning.

This is the final component of the **Weaver's Guild**, the one toward which your entire education has been aimed. It is not a course, but a calling. Your task is to create your masterwork, to move from apprentice to journeyman weaver. Over the next year, you will pour everything you have learned into a single, profound, individual effort.

The core texts by Darwin, Jacobs, and Hofstadter are guides. Darwin's work is your model for a synthesis of immense scale and empirical depth. Jacobs' is your model for weaving high theory with lived, human-scale reality. Hofstadter's *GEB* is your model for the intellectual playfulness, rigor, and multi-layered beauty of a true Grand Synthesis.

### **Component B: The Weaver's Guild Grand Synthesis Track (BPW 499)**

#### **Goal: To identify a significant "fracture" in the world and to design, execute, and defend "The Tug"—a tangible intervention that weaves a new, healing, or generative connection across it.**

This is a self-directed, year-long journey guided by your faculty advisor ("Master Weaver") and supported by your Peer Review Circle. It unfolds in five distinct phases.

---

### **Phase I: The Grand Question (Semester 1, Weeks 1-4)**

Your work begins not with a topic, but with an obsession. You will identify a disconnection that you cannot ignore. It may be local and immediate—perhaps the historical fracture in Höganäs between its industrial ceramic heritage and its modern identity, or the social disconnect between different community groups. Or it may be global and abstract—a disconnect between a scientific paradigm and its public understanding, or a fracture in our political discourse.

* **Process:** You will spend this month in deep inquiry, using the skills from BPW 101 to formulate a single, powerful "Grand Question" that will guide your entire year.
* **Deliverable:** A formal **Project Proposal**. This document introduces the "fracture," poses your Grand Question, outlines the disparate fields you intend to braid (e.g., neuroscience, medieval poetry, and game theory), proposes a potential form for your "Tug," and names your preferred Master Weaver.

### **Phase II: The Great Weaving (Semester 1, Weeks 5-12)**

This is the intellectual heart of your project. You will spend the rest of the first semester gathering and braiding your threads. This is a period of intense research, reading, and thinking, supported by regular meetings with your advisor and peer circle.

* **Process:** As you work, you will hold your synthesis up to the standards of our models. Are you unifying vast, disparate observations as **Darwin** did? Are you grounding abstract theory in the fine-grained detail of human life as **Jacobs** did? Are you finding the joyful, recursive, and unexpected connections between seemingly alien worlds as **Hofstadter** did?
* **Deliverable:** An **Annotated Synthesis & Mid-Point Review**. This is a comprehensive document showcasing your core research and, crucially, a narrative explanation of how you are weaving it together. You will present this work-in-progress to your advisor and peer circle for rigorous feedback.

### **Phase III: Prototyping "The Tug" (Semester 2, Weeks 13-18)**

In the second semester, you must translate your synthesis into a tangible intervention. An analysis is not enough; the Grand Synthesis must *act*.

* **Process:** You will create a "prototype" of your Tug. This is the concrete expression of your woven idea.
    * If your project is on bridging a community divide, your prototype could be the charter and first meeting plan for a new local organization in Höganäs.
    * If your project is on synthesizing an ethical framework for AI, your prototype could be a piece of pseudo-code and a detailed specification document.
    * If your project is on weaving art and ecology, your prototype could be a physical sculpture or a detailed proposal for a public art installation at Kvickbadet.
* **Studio Integration:** Your prototype and its potential consequences will become a central case study for discussion in the **Loom-Side Ethic (BPW 402)** seminar.

### **Phase IV: The Final Weave (Semester 2, Weeks 19-22)**

Based on feedback from the prototype phase and the ethical inquiries of the Loom-Side Ethic, you will spend this month refining your intervention and preparing your final presentation. This involves polishing your artifact and, just as importantly, crafting the powerful, clear, and compelling story of your year-long journey.

### **Phase V: The Presentation of the Tug (Semester 2, Weeks 23-24)**

This is the culmination of your entire degree. In a formal presentation to a panel of faculty, your peer circle, and invited guests from the university and community, you will defend your masterwork. The presentation has two distinct parts:

1.  **The Synthesis:** You will explain the "fracture" you identified, the disparate threads you chose to work with, and the intellectual and creative act of weaving them together into a coherent whole.
2.  **The Tug:** You will unveil your final intervention—your artifact, your policy, your story, your organization. You will then make a clear, passionate, and well-reasoned case for how this "gentle, deliberate pull" is designed to create a positive and meaningful resonance in the world.
