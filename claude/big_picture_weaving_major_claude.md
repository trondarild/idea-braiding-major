# Big-Picture Weaving
## Bachelor of Arts in Connective Intelligence

*"The universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose. We just haven't been asking the right questions in the right combinations yet."*

### Program Philosophy

Big-Picture Weaving operates on the radical premise that human knowledge has been artificially compartmentalized. We are thread-pullers, pattern-hunters, and connection-forgers. Our mission: to train minds capable of holding seemingly contradictory ideas in productive tension until new insights crystallize from their collision.

Students graduate not with narrow expertise, but with **connective intelligence**—the ability to weave disparate fields into novel frameworks that reveal hidden structures underlying reality.

## Core Requirements

### Foundation Sequence (Year 1-2)

**BPW 101: Catastrophic Curiosity**
Learn to follow questions past their comfort zones. Students practice the art of productive confusion, turning bewilderment into investigative fuel. Final project: Map one personal obsession across seven different academic disciplines.

**BPW 102: The Architecture of Wonder** 
Study how great minds made conceptual leaps. From Darwin's tangled bank to Einstein's thought experiments to Octavia Butler's speculative societies. Prerequisite: Willingness to have your worldview regularly demolished and rebuilt.

**BPW 201: Paradox Wrestling**
Intensive training in holding contradictions without premature resolution. Zen koans meet quantum mechanics meet social justice theory. Students develop comfort with cognitive dissonance as a creative tool.

**BPW 202: Systems Thinking for Misfits**
Everything connects to everything else, but how? Explore emergence, feedback loops, and unintended consequences across biology, economics, mythology, and urban planning. Warning: You may never see anything as isolated again.

### Concentration Tracks (Choose Two)

**Track A: The Science of Meaning-Making**
- Cognitive science meets philosophy meets anthropology
- How do humans create significance from chaos?
- Capstone: Design a new form of storytelling that changes how people think

**Track B: Civilization Debugging** 
- Economics, political science, history, and speculative fiction
- What makes societies thrive or collapse?
- Capstone: Propose solutions to one "wicked problem" using interdisciplinary insights

**Track C: Consciousness Cartography**

- Capstone: Create immersive scenarios of humanity 100 years hence

### Advanced Synthesis Courses

**BPW 301: Idea Sex**
Forced breeding of concepts from unrelated domains. Students must produce viable intellectual offspring from unlikely pairings. Previous successes: "Game theory for mycorrhizal networks," "Buddhist economics meets machine learning."

**BPW 302: The Elegant Universe of Metaphor**
Advanced pattern recognition across scales. How do the dynamics of ant colonies illuminate international relations? What can music theory teach us about DNA repair? Students develop fluency in analogical reasoning.

**BPW 401: Thesis as Time Machine**
Senior capstone project that attempts to solve a contemporary problem by synthesizing insights from multiple historical periods and diverse knowledge traditions. Must demonstrate how ancient wisdom and cutting-edge research can productively collide.

## Unique Pedagogical Methods

### The Question Cascade Protocol
Every assignment begins with students generating 50 questions about the topic. These questions then generate meta-questions. Continue until you reach questions so fundamental they make you slightly dizzy.

### Perspective Rotation Exercises
Students must argue any position from at least five radically different viewpoints: that of a medieval peasant, a mycorrhizal fungus, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, a hunter-gatherer, and a hypothetical alien anthropologist.

### The Confusion Portfolio
Students maintain ongoing documentation of what confuses them most. These confusion maps become research roadmaps. Most breakthrough insights emerge from the careful cultivation of bewilderment.

### Cognitive Jazz Sessions
Improvised intellectual jam sessions where students riff on ideas across disciplines. No preparation allowed—pure spontaneous synthesis. Recorded sessions become study materials for future pattern recognition.

---

## Assessment Philosophy

Traditional grades are replaced with:
- **Synthesis Scores**: How elegantly can you connect disparate ideas?
- **Question Quality Index**: How deep and generative are your inquiries?
- **Paradigm Shift Certificates**: Recognition for insights that genuinely change how classmates think
- **Intellectual Courage Badges**: Awarded for pursuing ideas despite social or academic resistance

### Senior Portfolio Requirements

1. **The Thread Map**: Visual representation of all major intellectual connections made during program
2. **Question Archaeology**: Documentation of how your deepest questions evolved and spawned new investigations
3. **Synthesis Demonstration**: Major creative work that couldn't exist without interdisciplinary thinking
4. **Teaching Moment**: Capacity to help others make unexpected connections

---

## Faculty Composition

Professors must demonstrate expertise in at least three unrelated fields and show evidence of productive intellectual boundary-crossing. Current faculty includes:
- A mycologist-musician who studies fungal network intelligence
- A quantum physicist-poet exploring consciousness and measurement
- An economic anthropologist-permaculturist designing regenerative systems
- A neuroscientist-philosopher-comedian investigating the nature of humor

### Visiting Wisdom Keepers
Regular rotating appointments from:
- Indigenous knowledge holders
- Artist-scientists
- Contemplative practitioners
- "Failed" academics who pursued questions beyond disciplinary boundaries
- Brilliant autodidacts and intellectual misfits

---

## Career Outcomes

Big-Picture Weaving graduates become:
- **Synthesis Consultants**: Help organizations solve complex problems through interdisciplinary approaches
- **Futures Architects**: Design scenarios and systems for long-term thinking
- **Translation Specialists**: Bridge communication gaps between expert communities
- **Innovation Catalysts**: Generate breakthrough ideas by combining existing knowledge in novel ways
- **Complexity Navigators**: Guide decision-making in uncertain, interconnected systems
- **Meaning-Making Entrepreneurs**: Create new forms of sense-making for information-saturated societies

---

## Admission Requirements

No standardized tests. Instead, applicants submit:

1. **A Question That Haunts You**: 500-word exploration of one question that genuinely keeps you awake
2. **Weird Connections Portfolio**: Evidence of your capacity to see unexpected relationships
3. **Learning Autobiography**: How your mind has changed, including productive failures and confusion
4. **Intellectual Courage Statement**: Describe a time you pursued an idea despite social pressure to conform

### The Only Prerequisite
Unshakeable conviction that everything is more interesting than it first appears, and that the most important insights live at the intersections no one else is exploring.
