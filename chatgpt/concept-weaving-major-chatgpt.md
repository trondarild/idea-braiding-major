## Department of Big-Picture Weaving

**Major: B.A. in Big-Picture Weaving**
*“Chase every question until it giggles and spills its secrets.”*

### Program Description

Big-Picture Weaving trains students to trace, knot, and braid ideas across domains—science, art, history, metaphysics, technology, mythology—into coherent tapestries. Students learn to track the genealogy of questions, follow them into unexpected territories, and tug at conceptual ropes until structures reveal themselves. The program assumes no discipline is self-contained: physics leaks into poetry, theology echoes in code, and geometry hums inside music.

---

## Degree Requirements

* **Core Courses**: 7
* **Electives (from weaving clusters)**: 6
* **Capstone Project**: 1 woven artifact (can be a book, machine, ritual, simulation, map, opera, etc.)
* **Thread Journal**: a lifelong, ever-expanding catalog of questions and their metamorphoses.

---

## Core Curriculum

1. **WOV 101 – Orientation: The First Tangle**
   Students map every question that has kept them awake. The map becomes the first entry in the Thread Journal.

2. **WOV 110 – Taxonomies of Wonder**
   From Aristotle’s *Categories* to Borges’ “Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge.” Classification as both tool and trap.

3. **WOV 201 – Braiding Epistemologies**
   Comparative methods of knowing: experiment, revelation, storytelling, formal proof, divination, computation. Exercises in translating one into another.

4. **WOV 210 – The Giggle Threshold**
   How to chase a question until it flips inside out: paradox, aporia, koan, dialectic, recursion, glitch art, Gödelian self-reference.

5. **WOV 301 – Cosmogramatics**
   Techniques for drawing whole-world diagrams: medieval mappae mundi, indigenous songlines, cybernetic block diagrams, system-dynamics simulations.

6. **WOV 320 – Entanglement Studio**
   Collaborative lab. Teams pick three unrelated phenomena (e.g., tides, lullabies, stock bubbles) and weave them into one explanatory or aesthetic rope.

7. **WOV 499 – Capstone: Tugging the Rope**
   Each student constructs a grand weave. At the end, the rope is tugged: the work must strain against itself until something unforeseen emerges.

## Weaving Clusters (Electives)

* **Myth–Math–Machine**
  Courses on sacred geometry, computing as ritual, AI as oracle, myth as algorithm.

* **Time & Its Knots**
  Linear, cyclic, deep time; calendars, entropy, memory architectures.

* **Body–World Feedbacks**
  Phenomenology, robotics, extended mind, ritual movement, architecture.

* **Voices Across the Abyss**
  Translation, interspecies communication, semiotics, the rhetoric of silence.

* **Fractures & Repairs**
  Utopias, dystopias, collapse studies, resilience theory, mending practices (kintsugi, patchwork, dialectical repair).

## Orientation Syllabus (Sample, Week 1–10)

**Week 1:** Write every unanswered question you’ve ever had. No pruning.
**Week 2:** Take one question and follow its answers across five disciplines.
**Week 3:** Build a “family tree of confusion” showing how questions breed new questions.
**Week 4:** Read Borges’ *Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius*. Redraw the world in its image.
**Week 5:** Map the metaphors you live inside. Are they prisons or bridges?
**Week 6:** Keep a log of all coincidences you notice. Recast them as causal diagrams.
**Week 7:** Translate a physics law into a myth. Translate a myth into a theorem.
**Week 8:** Create a taxonomy of laughter (comic, nervous, cosmic). Link each to epistemology.
**Week 9:** Design a ritual for tugging on reality.
**Week 10:** First rope pull: present your tangled weave to peers and watch what unravels.

Perfect — let’s make this concrete. Below is a **reading list** for each course in the Big-Picture Weaving curriculum. I’ll list 3–5 real, major works per course, spanning philosophy, science, literature, mythology, anthropology, and systems thinking. These are the “anchor texts” — students can branch out from them, but they form the rope’s initial strands.

Would you like me to **expand each list to 6–8 works** (closer to a real syllabus with both primary and secondary texts), or should we keep the anchor-text minimalism and build a complementary “thread library” that students explore according to their chosen weave?
